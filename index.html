<p id="p">You shoot awake, gasping for breath as it slowly sinks in that it was a nightmare. You look around the room. Still dark out. Your alarm clock says 2:22am, but you don't see yourself getting back to sleep. You force yourself to get up, and begin walking to the kitchen. As you begin to make coffee, you dread having to go to work in a few hours. You hate your job, but it pays okay. Enough to afford a decent house, which is more than can be said for most people your age. You're lucky, you guess, but it never feels that way. The coffee is done, and you prepare yourself a cup, before moving over to your desk. As you sip your coffee, you hesitantly pick up your dream diary. Your therapist reccomended it, despite your discomfort with the concept of recording your nightmares. You open it up, and begin to write.</p>
